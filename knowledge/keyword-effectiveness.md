## Rating Scale

- **Excellent** - Reliably produces the intended effect
- **Good** - Usually works, occasional misses
- **Moderate** - Works sometimes, context-dependent
- **Poor** - Rarely produces intended effect
- **Counterproductive** - Actively works against intended effect

<!-- This file is populated automatically as you use the system.
     Keywords are tracked during iteration logging and reflection.

     Example section format:

     ## Category Keywords

     | Keyword | Rating | Actual Effect | Notes |
     |---------|--------|---------------|-------|
     | `keyword name` | **Rating** | What it actually produces | Context and usage notes |

     A "Counterproductive Keywords (Avoid)" section is also generated
     listing keywords to actively avoid, with what to use instead.
