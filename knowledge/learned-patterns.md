Patterns are organized by category and sorted by confidence level.

<!-- This file is populated automatically as you use the system.
     Patterns are extracted during reflection from iteration data.
     Confidence levels: low (1-2 tests) → medium (3-5 tests, >70% success) → high (6+ tests, >80% success)

     Example pattern format:

     ## Category Name

     ### pattern-name — _confidence level_ (N tests, X% success)
     - **Problem:** What goes wrong without this knowledge
     - **Solution:** What to do instead
     - **Example (bad):** `prompt that fails`
     - **Example (good):** `prompt that works`
